Hi gaurav_bohra sir,

I tried to replicate everything exactly as per your task, especially the requirement:

> Modify CoreDNS or create a network policy that breaks service discovery  
> Diagnose with tools like nslookup, dig, tcpdump, and restore functionality

Here are the detailed steps I followed. This is not based on my own interpretation — every folder and file was created to fully match the intent of your task:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🧱 1. `charts/my-app/`
- Contains a **Helm chart** that defines:
  - **Backend Deployment & Service** using `http-echo`
  - **Frontend Deployment & Service** using NGINX
  - **Ingress** that routes:
    - `/api` to backend-service
    - `/ui` to frontend-service
  - Enables **TLS** using `tls-cert` secret
- Purpose: Provide a declarative, templated way to deploy all app resources

---

### 📦 2. `argocd/app.yaml`
- ArgoCD Application manifest configured with:
  - **Auto-sync**, **prune**, **self-heal**
  - Helm chart source from Git repo
- Purpose: Enables GitOps deployment via ArgoCD UI/CLI

---

### 💥 3. `tools/coredns-patch.yaml`
- Patches the CoreDNS `Corefile` to **break service discovery**
- Removes internal Kubernetes DNS plugin
- Purpose: Simulate a DNS failure scenario

---

### 🔐 4. `tools/network-policy-block.yaml`
- Applies a **NetworkPolicy** that blocks DNS (UDP port 53) traffic to `kube-system`
- Purpose: Alternate method to simulate DNS resolution failure

---

### 🔍 5. `tools/diagnosis.md`
- Contains step-by-step usage of:
  - `nslookup`, `dig`, `tcpdump` for DNS diagnostics
- Also includes commands to **restore CoreDNS** or remove the network policy
- Purpose: Provide recovery steps after simulating DNS issues

---

### 🚫 6. `misconfigs/values-bad.yaml`
- Contains an intentionally invalid Helm value:
  ```yaml
  replicaCount: "three"  # should be an integer
````

* Purpose: Used to simulate a failed deployment and test ArgoCD’s rollback feature
