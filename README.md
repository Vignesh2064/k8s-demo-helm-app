Hi **gaurav_bohra** sir,

I tried to replicate everything exactly as per your task, especially the requirement:

> **Modify CoreDNS or create a network policy that breaks service discovery**  
> **Diagnose with tools like nslookup, dig, tcpdump, and restore functionality**

Here are the detailed steps I followed. This is not based on my own interpretation — every folder and file was created to fully match the intent of your task:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🧱 1. `charts/my-app/`
Contains a **Helm chart** that defines:
- **Backend Deployment & Service** using [`http-echo`](https://github.com/hashicorp/http-echo)
- **Frontend Deployment & Service** using NGINX
- **Ingress** that routes:
  - `/api` → `backend-service`
  - `/ui`  → `frontend-service`
- TLS enabled via a secret named `tls-cert`

📌 **Purpose**: Declarative, reusable way to deploy the application using Helm.

---

### 📦 2. `argocd/app.yaml`
ArgoCD Application manifest configured with:
- 🔄 **Auto-sync**
- 🧹 **Prune**
- ❤️ **Self-heal**
- 🎯 Source points to the Helm chart in this repo

📌 **Purpose**: Manage deployments via GitOps using ArgoCD.

---

### 💥 3. `tools/coredns-patch.yaml`
Patches CoreDNS `Corefile` to **break Kubernetes service discovery**:
- Removes internal Kubernetes DNS plugin block

📌 **Purpose**: Simulate a DNS failure scenario from inside the cluster.

---

### 🔐 4. `tools/network-policy-block.yaml`
Creates a **NetworkPolicy** to block:
- **UDP traffic on port 53** (DNS)
- Target: All pods attempting to reach CoreDNS in `kube-system` namespace

📌 **Purpose**: Another way to simulate DNS resolution failure.

---

### 🔍 5. `tools/diagnosis.md`
Step-by-step instructions to debug DNS issues using:
- 🔎 `nslookup`
- 🧠 `dig`
- 📡 `tcpdump`

Also includes recovery steps:
- Restart CoreDNS
- Delete the blocking NetworkPolicy

📌 **Purpose**: Help diagnose and restore broken DNS functionality.

---

### 🚫 6. `misconfigs/values-bad.yaml`
Intentionally invalid Helm values:
```yaml
replicaCount: "three"  # ❌ should be an integer
````

📌 **Purpose**: Simulate a misconfigured deployment. ArgoCD will:

* Show app status as "Degraded"
* Allow rollback or correction via Git

---

🙏 I hope this aligns perfectly with your expectations. Every file and step was crafted to reflect **exactly what the original task described**, not interpreted loosely. Kindly review and let me know if you would like any further improvement.
